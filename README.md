# Rat-Removal
Before we start, I suggest you use [LiquidSquid's Guide](https://liquidsquid1.github.io/rat-removal/). It's better. Still here? Alright, lets go!

1. [Malwarebytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) is known for being decent at removing R.A.T's. It is paid but before you start throwing tomatoes at me, the free trial is free (Obviously) and you don't have to put your Mom's credit card number with those silly little numbers on the back. (Also if any Anti-Virus is asking for you to put in details, don't do it!! The R.A.T isn't removed yet, and if they haven't already they will steal that info.)

2. [Autoruns](https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Autoruns.zip) is also good at removing things like R.A.T's, also yes this is stolen directly from Liquid's guide, shush! Anyways here is what to delete:
- Any .scr files
- Anything that is highlighted in red
- Anything with just random ass letters/numbers in the name

  Quick note: Make sure you are SURE that what you are deleting isn't important, you wanna keep your PC! (I'd hope..)

3. Make sure you didn't turn anything off in Window's defender like Real-Time virus detection, you need that.

4. Factory reset: Too scared that it's lingering on your PC? Do a Factory reset, and make sure you do it correctly!

R.A.T's sometimes hide in your files fully, so if nothing is detected and your sure you have one or just wanna be safe, factory reset!

**When the R.A.T is gone, RESET YOUR PASSWORDS, all of them! For example I had the same password for almost FIVE years, don't be like me! (It's changed now, don't get any ideas.)**

Final note: Some R.A.T's hide in your BIOS, so they can stay even after a reset (It's not that common at least from what I've seen but don't take my word.) and if that is the case, well... good luck.
