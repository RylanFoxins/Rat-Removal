  <h1>Rat Removal</h1>
  <p>Before we start, I suggest you use <a href="https://liquidsquid1.github.io/rat-removal/" target="_blank">LiquidSquid's Guide</a>. It's better. Still here? Alright, let’s go!</p>

  <h2>1. Malwarebytes</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank">Malwarebytes</a> is known for being decent at removing R.A.T.s. It is paid, but before you start throwing tomatoes at me, the free trial is free (obviously). You don't have to put your Mom's credit card number with those silly little numbers on the back. (Also, if any Anti-Virus asks you to put in details, <b>don’t do it!</b> The R.A.T. isn’t removed yet, and if they haven’t already, they will steal that info.)</p>

  <h2>2. Autoruns</h2>
  <p><a href="https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Autoruns.zip" target="_blank">Autoruns</a> is also good at removing R.A.T.s. Yes, this is stolen directly from Liquid's guide, shush! Anyway, here’s what to delete:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any <code>.scr</code> files</li>
    <li>Anything that is highlighted in red</li>
    <li>Anything with just random letters/numbers in the name</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    <p><b>Quick note:</b> Make sure you are <b>SURE</b> that what you are deleting isn't important. You want to keep your PC! (I’d hope...)</p>
  </div>

  <h2>3. Check Windows Defender</h2>
  <p>Make sure you didn’t turn off anything in Windows Defender, like Real-Time Virus Detection—you need that!</p>

  <h2>4. Factory Reset</h2>
  <p>Too scared that it’s lingering on your PC? Do a factory reset, and make sure you do it correctly!</p>
  <p>R.A.T.s sometimes hide fully in your files, so if nothing is detected and you're sure you have one—or just want to be safe—factory reset!</p>

  <div class="warning">
    <p><b>When the R.A.T. is gone, RESET YOUR PASSWORDS!</b> All of them! For example, I had the same password for almost FIVE years. Don’t be like me! (It's changed now, don’t get any ideas.)</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Final Note</h2>
  <p>Some R.A.T.s hide in your BIOS, so they can stay even after a reset. It’s not that common (at least from what I’ve seen), but don’t take my word for it. If that’s the case, well... good luck.</p>
